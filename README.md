# LOTR Converter 🧙‍♂️💰

A simple **SwiftUI practice app** that converts between different currencies from the Lord of the Rings universe.  
Built as an exercise to learn **SwiftUI, @State, @Binding, sheets, and basic data modeling**.

## ✨ Features
- Select a **from** and **to** currency using a custom sheet.
- Enter an amount and instantly see the converted value.
- Conversion rates are based on Middle-earth currency:
  - 1 Gold Piece = 4 Gold Pennies  
  - 1 Gold Penny = 4 Silver Pieces  
  - 1 Silver Piece = 4 Silver Pennies  
  - 1 Silver Penny = 100 Copper Pennies
- Practice of SwiftUI concepts:
  - `@State` and `@Binding`
  - `LazyVGrid`
  - `sheet` presentation
  - Model logic in `enum Currency`
  - Custom `View` components (e.g. `CurrencyIcon`, `ExchangeRate`)

## 🛠️ Tech
- **Swift** + **SwiftUI**
- Xcode 15+
- No external dependencies (pure SwiftUI practice)

## 🚀 Purpose
This is a **learning project**, not a production app.  
The goal was to get more comfortable with SwiftUI state management and layout.
